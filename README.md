# Basic Go Server

This is a basic Go server that serves HTTP requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Running the Server

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see output indicating that the server is running.

### Accessing the Server

Once the server is running, you can access it in your web browser or using a tool like curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

This server responds to HTTP requests with a simple message. You can modify the response message or add additional endpoints as needed by editing the `main.go` file.
